Then, run the app

`yarn start`

Then, in your browser, open http://localhost:3000/ to view it! ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰

This is a sample project created with:
- React
- Typescript
- Redux
- redux-thunk
- redux-persist
- lodash

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I used react persist and local storage to save your search queue and results, so if you reload the page you won't lose the state.
